1.	Objectives *(A brief review of the project objectives and any changes that have occurred):*

We are happy to report that all objectives set out for the AY 2012-2013 in our initial grant proposal have been completed. These are:

* Compilation of the first data set for the Princeton Prosody Archive (PPA)
* Testing of initial user interface features
* Investigation of access issues and long term maintenance for the next five years
* Hosting a summit of literary scholars and technologists to provide input on the PPA in its first form

2.	Deliverables *(Clear, concise description of the expected outcomes and benefits of the project):*

3.	Accomplishments *(A brief summary of progress made towards realizing those deliverables since the last reporting period):*

4.	Challenges *(Any setbacks or challenges since the last reporting period):*

5.	Project Personnel *(Significant board, management, or staff changes since the last reporting period):*

In addition to the Advisory and Technology boards listed in the grant proposal, there have been two significant additions to our team.  Meagan R. Wilson, a PhD student in the Department of English at Princeton, has taken over as project manager for Grant Wythoff, who began a postdoc at Columbia University in September 2013.  Travis Brown, Assistant Director of Research and Development at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities, has taken on a very prominent role in helping us develop the Archive.  Brown was hired to produce a Drupal-based search engine for the collections of text we received from HathiTrust, entirely using funds from the David A. Gardner Magic Grant from Princeton.

The team has submitted a long paper proposal to the Digital Humanities 2014 conference in Lausanne, Switzerland.
